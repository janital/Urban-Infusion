# Design guidelines for Urban Infusion

<br>

### Theme

Urban Infusion is a mix of modern and traditional, and the theme will reflect that. Because it is tea we will want a earth'y natural theme that is modern and a bit traditional, and also calm.

<br>

### Colour scheme

Urban Infusion have not provided a colour scheme. Looking at other tea shops we have seen that beige/brown and green are consistent on those sites. These colours represents the calmness of nature and warmth this e-shop wants to reflect to it's customers. To clearly communicate Urban Infusion's main values, the suggested colour scheme for the site is:

<br>

Main colour: #EEEDE8 (Beige)

Accent colour: #588157 (Green)

Text colour: #6D6875 (Dark purple)

<br>

### Hierachy and layout

The most important message on the site is the products and what they represent. Our goal with the site is to draw customers and create interest.

<br>

The buttons, in combination with descriptive images, are the most important elements of the site because they navigate the user to the products and allow them to shop, read about the products, read about other customers experiences with the products, and so on. Buttons will therefore have an accent to increase the visual priority on the site. 

<br>

The different sections we will have on our landing page is hero, other cooperations, featured, values, about, products and testimonials.

<br>

Sections layout of the landing page:

- The "hero" section will contain a slider with different images to communicate some of the companies values, as well as a CTA (Call to Action) button.

- The companies that Urban Infusion cooperates with will be displayed in a row underneath the header to highlight the validity of Urban Infusion as a company and e-shop that customers can trust.

- The "featured" section will display product images of the most popular products with individual button to direct the user to that specific product page.

- The values of Urban Infusion will be displayed in a row so that the customers can understand what to expect from the company and the products they sell.

- For the "about" section there will be used a Z-layout, which resembles how the human eye moves while it read texts, to create visual interest throughout the large text.

- The products will be displayed in a single row with a slider.

- The testimonials will be displayed in a row.

We will have some text on images when it comes to buttons, but we will use colour overlay and blur to improve the readability inside the the button, but not on the image as a whole.

<br>

### Icons

We will use icons for some features like wishlist, shopping cart, user profile as well as some illustrations.

The icons will be coloured to fit the theme of the site.

Icon pack for some site features: https://phosphoricons.com/

No packs chosen for illustrations yet.

### Typography

Because Urban Infusion is a mix of modern and traditional we will use a sans serif font as the main, portraying the modern side, and a cursive font for accents portraying the traditional side. We want don't want an overly bold look, and will use a font with hard egdes.

Main font: Montserrat

Accent font: Hurricane

Font scale: 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 / 24 / 30 / 36 / 44 / 52 / 62 / 74 / 86 / 98

<br>

### Spacing

Spacings: 2 / 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 80 / 96 / 128

<br>

### Border rounding

Montserrat, out main font is very hard, we will therefore use no border rounding for for elements, but will use full rounding on buttons. The stark contrast between a hard enviroment created by general elements and soft edge of the buttons will draw in the users attention.

<br>

### Shadows

We will use shadow but very softly, only to create dimension of the site, but still make it calm.
