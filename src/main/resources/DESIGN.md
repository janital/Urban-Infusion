# Design guidelines for Urban Infusion

<br>

### Theme

Urban Infusion is a mix of modern and traditional, and the theme will reflect that. Because it is tea we will want a earth'y natural theme that is modern and a bit traditional, and also calm.

<br>

### Color scheme

Urban Infusion have not provided a colour scheme. Looking at other tea shops we have seen that beige/brown and green are consistent on those sites. To clearly communicate what Urban Infusion is we have chosen to do use those colours.

<br>

Main colour: #EEEDE8 (Beige)

Accent colour: #588157 (Green)

Text colour: #6D6875 (Dark purple)

<br>

### Hierachy and layout

The most important message/product on the site is the products, Our goal with the site is to draw customers and create interest.

<br>

For elements it is the buttons that is the most important because they navigate the user to the products and allow them to shop etc. Buttons will therefore have an accent to increase the visual priority on the site. 

<br>

The different sections we will have on our site is hero, other cooperations, featured, values, about, products and testimonials.

<br>

Layout of the sections:

- Hero section will contain a slider with different images to communicate some of the companies values, as well as a CTA button.

- The companies Urban Infusion cooperates with will be displayed in a row underneath the header.

- The featured section will display the product images of the most popular products with a button to direct the user to the product page.

- The values will be displayed in a row.

- For the about section which will be very content heavy we will use Z-layout to create visual interest throughout the large text.

- The products will be displayes in a single row with a slider.

- The testimonials will be displayed in a row.

We will have some text on images when it comes to buttons, but we will use color overlay and blur to improve the readability inside the the button, but not on the image as a whole.

<br>

### Icons

We will use icons for some features like wishlist, shopping cart, user profile as well as some illustrations.

The icons will be coloured to fit the theme of the site.

### Typography

Because Urban Infusion is a mix of modern and traditional we will use a sans serif font as the main, portraying the modern side, and a cursive font for accents portraying the traditional side. We want don't want an overly bold look, and will use a font with hard egdes.

Main font: Montserrat

Accent font: Hurricane

Font scale: 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 / 24 / 30 / 36 / 44 / 52 / 62 / 74 / 86 / 98

<br>

### Spacing

Spacings: 2 / 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 80 / 96 / 128

<br>

### Border rounding

Montserrat, out main font is very hard, we will therefore use no border rounding for for elements, but will use full rounding on buttons. The stark contrast between a hard enviroment created by general elements and soft edge of the buttons will draw in the users attention.

<br>

### Shadows

We will use shadow but very softly, only to create dimension of the site, but still make it calm.
